Deep clean right now is not possible without\r\npaid software.\r\n    \r\nMost Mac OS cleaner apps doesn't really boost the performance as much as advertised. I have tried all sorts of existing\r\napps in AppStore, the result wasn't promising.\r\n    \r\nSo I come up with an idea of writing a shell script to do this.\r\n\r\nI tried on my own 2 mac, Macbook Pro and Macbook Air, with both running Mac OS X 10.9.3.. Result seems to be exceeding my\r\nexpectation: 7.5 GB spaces are cleaned, and the system response has been drastically boosted..\r\n\r\nScript Usage\r\n=============\r\n    \r\nCopy the script to your disk. and execute \"sh clean\\_my\\_mac.sh\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
